      <p class="small-12 columns">
        Animation and Design studies are one of the most creative coursework that students take up. Most coursework for animation programs are offered in the form of a Bachelor degree at the undergraduate level. At later stages Masters level course work and doctoral works are advised. Students learn and hence write/essay and document a variety of animation coursework such as that of 3D animation, animation history, visual designs, editing, storyboarding, digital sound design, hand drawn and motion works and more. In addition to the above students are also expected to work on UG level and PG level language courses or other art courses based on the selection of Animation studies. In our experience, animation students are more often challenged in writing because of the lack of time that goes with their complex courseworkâ€™s. Students also need assistance in their essays when working at different levels of animation studies. Sometimes students feel stuck in a route. An animation study assignment at undergraduate levels might not be up to require quality in the graduate level. Students need the extra help to know how to improve their essay writing to graduate levels. Similarly while students understand technology, the use-application and other details that would certainly honor them in their future career, the University would demand them to show what they know in the means of writing. Most students are challenged in translating the work they did into an essay or a report. 
  Animation students are assisted by providing them with animation assignment writing samples. We present short samples to students in order to understand what format would work better for their essays and reports. University prescribed formats is also supplied by students which the writer would use to put together a basic template for student perusal. Usually this is the starting point of interaction we have with students. Animation studies and creative design tutors works with students to understand what their actual needs. 
  Some of the animation coursework classifications that we have handled are in 3-D modeling coursework, animation history, character design and software courses and portfolio courses. Each of these coursework requires different levels of support. Students in Animation History often require detailed theoretical analysis and formulate analysis viewpoints. Animation history assignments are usually structured to help student understand history and its applications in animation. So in constructing such assignments our writers have to work on connecting past and the present. Writing has to be typically structured as to how the historical understanding holds relevance for the student in present day. On the other hand writing reports for 3D modeling courses where an implementation of a project is discussed, the writing should be more analytic and less theoretical. Theoretical details are usually brought in as a separate literature review section or as a background study section. These minute details are what lead to the differences in grading for the animation study assignments and our writers are experts in understanding the minuscule differences.
