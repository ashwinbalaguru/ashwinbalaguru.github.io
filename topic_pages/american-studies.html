      <p class="small-12 columns">
        American Studies is about study of American history, growth of American civilization and society. English literature and American Studies go hand in hand as history of American is never complete without the inclusion of English literature in its varied forms that reveals much about it. In fact as most people are unaware, American studies is called the sister subject of English literature. One cannot really exist without the other. This study embodies and reflects upon the culture of the American people, history of America. It combines empirical data and qualitative data and helps the students to gain perspective of the situation from a holistic angle. American studies are a diverse assembly of many inters-related subjects of socialism, capitalism, feminism, colonialism and beliefs that prevailed in America from ancient times to the present time.
  American studies and creative writing goes hand in hand because a complete study of history needs to be both objective and creative in analysis, in order for students to hold a passion for it. History writing without drawing on facts would not portray an accurate picture. However presenting facts as it was - is not the objective of analysis. Analysis has to be done from multiple frames. At the core of English literature studies and American studies are the need to use multiple frames in order to understand what happened. Viewing history through a single lens is like a single person’s perspective. It is neither complete nor soul fetching. In most American culture and political studies, the Universities expect student to draw from a variety of perspectives, however an emphasis on a specific objective is also expected. Our writers have the knack and the ability to find out the exact objective of each assignment and combine perspectives in order to argue for that objective. The different lens of realism, liberalism and more are used in order to help student present a unique and argumentative point. With many students graduating with American studies as a part of their regular coursework, the need to present unique topics and arguments to the instructor has become a rather complex dilemma. Most students who approach us state their problem at the onset, as ‘we need a research argumentative essay, but not one that churns out facts’. We agree with them. Facts are available for everybody and we do have writers who can present fact writing and history discussions from secondary literature and primary sources for high school level and undergraduate studies. We also have writers who look beyond the ‘churning out of facts’, writers who are experienced in presenting argumentative essays from multiple viewpoints, who can add complexity in writing as required and work with sentencing that makes the essay a worthy ready for student. Student’s input in the form of ideas for structure, thesis statements or sources they want to be represented are also added in. The work is highly personalized to the student needs and ensures that student meet the grade points they deserve. Work with use on your American Studies essays.
