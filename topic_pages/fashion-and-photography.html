        Creative writing about modern fashion and lifestyle is at the core of fashion and photography course assignments. Photography courses prepare the student with the basics of essential photography such as digital photo editing, workshops of modeling and fashion lighting and more. Students are trained in indoor and outdoor photography works and there are intensive practical training workshops arranged from week to week. The practical training sessions often culminate with writing assignments on what has been learnt, options to be selected when in certain case scenarios working as a professional photographer and more. Most photography programs are a one or two year programs so the students are challenged a lot in translating most of their practical curriculum in writing for or for making their own portfolios. In addition combining fashion studies with photography means students also have to study styles of fashion as applicable in photography such as the minimalist version and others. This is the most commercial style of photography and is employed for almost all advertisements requiring that unique appeal to the diva within. Students usually are expected to study fashion element incorporation by working with existing research on fashion photography, the contemporary works of fashion photographers and also the review of media articles on modern fashion and lifestyle consumptions
  Creative writing about modern fashion and lifestyle requires a more critical writerâ€™s perception than any other. We have helped students to write essays on fashion photography with existing research studies. We aid student in formulating arguments to support their essay themes. In thus assisting student we ensure that students are using current articles and sourcing. Current articles are important as fashion photography trends are fast changing and students have to show their expertise in keeping up with the change. Most Universities in fact pose same or similar questions for students to write their assignment on year after year. The challenge for the student lies in the way they structure their assignments around contemporary trends, or uniquely present an assignment. Students here require fresh perspective in assignment writing. Most students take up existing assignments given as guidance by instructors or seniors of the same University. Using them as a frame of reference student will end up presenting non-creative writing. Either an existing theory or an existing reference is used and this leads to essays that are completely unoriginal. There are much chances for students getting a bare passable grade or even lesser in such contexts. 
  Our assignment writers are experts in creative writing. Modern fashion and lifestyle trends as can be applied to photography are used in essay writing. Writers furthermore work with the students from gathering the requirement specification from student end to the final completion of the work. This ensures that students contribute to the writing process also, and are able to ensure that essays are customized to suit their styles of writing.
