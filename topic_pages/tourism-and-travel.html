      <p class="small-12 columns">
        Tourism and travel are growing multibillion dollar industries. They work hand in hand with the hospitality industry. It naturally follows that the career options in these industries have touched a never before high. Almost every country has tourism options based on the land, location, heritage and history. Countries which have developed their tourism settings face an economic advantage. With the economic collapse of recent times, more nations have had to focus on tourism as one of the many businesses supporting their infrastructure. As with the expansion of any business sector in the global economy, talented young adults are needed to support and run the system. We welcome students with aspiring careers in the tourism and travel sector. Our assignment writing services help students develop their own creative potential. We also offer writing services for businesses and young student interns working for travel and tourism businesses.
  The nature of writing for students aspiring to make their niche in the travel and tourism business differs significantly from any other. Essay writing for this segment will involve many different types. We have one set of students who have come to us with essay writing needs in creative travel writing. Creative travel writing by itself segments off into multiple divisions. Universities expect students to work on a real travel experience and narrate it in an insightful and also alluring way for potential tourists to the country and location. This is considered as prep work for students aiming to enter the industry. Business students work on tourism and travel essays with a marketing perspective. Here the intent is to sell the location, its attributes and places of interest. Creative travel writing is also done as assignments that ask students to research on specific locations around the world. Here creative travel writing is combined with research articles on the location, its value as a tourist spot, and application of hospitality and marketing indicators on the location. Apart from creative essaying, the other types of essays are based on specific perspectives. We have handled essays for students who want specific heritage value analyzed or some location (might be the birth place of an artist) and we have written essays on the artists. Some works also require non-essay compositions such as building a collage, a picture portfolio, web content collection, tourism index and ratings and more.
  Tourism and travel writing will vary based on which career the student would choose to enter. At the promotional level, working with marketing or as a tourism journalist, students are required to observe, focus and listen to the place they are reporting on or building the promotional portfolio for. On the other hand a student in a business setting will be exposed to creative writing to a lesser extent and would be expected to focus on the background aspects, such as value associated with location, and more. In contemporary University curriculums all these aspects are compiled together. Students definitely need that extra help in essay writing to understand how writing could vary subtly between these different requirements and we are here to assist.
