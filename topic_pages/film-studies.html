      <p class="small-12 columns">
        ‘Film studies’ or ‘Film and media studies’ as it is often offered by Universities, deals primarily with advancing the proficiency of students in the theory, history and contemporary advances of film and media production. Film and media studies hold significance in the current globalized and internetworked environment. Businesses make use of television and internet to advertise products and services in the form of short films. However an in-depth understanding of contemporary applications is possible only in a study of history and this is the role played by film and media studies.
  Film students are often challenged when it comes to writing assignments in film and media studies. The challenges arise in part because of the music theoretical nature of analyzing existing research studies on the topic. Movies although taken up for contemporary analysis are to be viewed with different lens of production as offered here in theory. Students might find it difficult to express their thoughts in abstract or in the application of the different lens or frames of productions. Having an essay writer assist them will help them in many ways in such a situation. Our essay writing services offers students different styles and forms of writing. We often present student with samples of our writers in order to make the student understand writer style and students get to interact with writers through emails to put forward their points. Writers encapsulate the points using their expert skills and construct Grade A essays from them. 
  Primarily our essay writers are well versed in creative writing.  Creative writing is necessary for film and media studies as film students need to trigger both creativity and imagination when applying theories to film analysis. The theories formulated in social and cultural studies needs to be creatively applied to film works in order to critique the films. There may be established techniques of criticism that the University will guide a student in and then there might also be techniques where the film students are expected to contribute something unique by way of analysis. In this context, our essay writers will help formulate creative application of socio-cultural theories. Writers are well versed in the more traditional research based ideas and criticisms and are also versed in the more current research models employed for criticism. 
  Secondly film and media studies being an interdisciplinary program expects its students to draw their ideas for essays from a variety of disciplines, inclusive of but not limited to socio cultural studies, anthropology, art and literature, and others. Students are assisted in their essay writing by writers who are proficient in mixing works from different disciplines in order to present that succinct yet critical art touch that is expected in essaying.
  Film students are also asked to watch movies and critically review them on an entire breadth of coursework. These forms of essays are usually comprehensive and expect students to present main points of criticism. Essay guidance will help students in identifying the main points and assures a good grade to film students.
